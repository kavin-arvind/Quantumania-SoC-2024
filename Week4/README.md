# Algorithms

We touched upon some basic quantum algorithms before in Section 1.4

This week we will look at some more involved algorithms and their implementations. Although these algorithms are important because they demonstrate the huge potential of quantum computers, one should keep in mind that every algorithm has its own specification.
