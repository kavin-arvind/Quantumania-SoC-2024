# Basics of Quantum Circuits

Now that the basics are covered, we will start with Quantum Circuits.

The reading material for this week is `Section 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4`
and `Section 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4`.

This week we shall start the coding part of the SoC by making some basic quantum circuits using the open-source Python SDK for Quantum Computation, **Qiskit**. 

[Here is a link to set it up](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/tree/main/notebooks/ch-prerequisites#).

You can also register for the [IBM Quantum Challenge](https://challenges.quantum.ibm.com/2024) to learn more about quantum circuits by trying out their notebooks.
