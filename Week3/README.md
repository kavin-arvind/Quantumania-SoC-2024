# Applications

This week we will look at some surprising applications of Quantum Computing in communication. We also look at another framework to represent quantum systems: The Density Operator.

Reading Material:
* Section 2.3 (Supersense coding)
* Section 2.4 (Density operator)
* Section 2.5 (EPR and Bell inequality)
