    "# Super Dense Coding Assignment\n",

    "In the Super Dense Coding protocol, Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled two-qubit state (Bell state). Alice can send 2 bits of classical information to Bob by applying a specific quantum gate based on her message and sending her qubit to Bob. Bob can then decode the message by applying a set of operations on the received qubit.\n",
